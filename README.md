# Jira exporter for Prometheus that uses the API to fetch data

Fetches statistics from Jira using the API.

Useful for those who run a Cloud jira and can't use the excellent and much more advanced [Prometheus exporter](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217960/prometheus-exporter-for-jira). Use that one first.
